**Please note that I am no longer working on this project as I moved to Joplin for managing my notes.
Please let me know if anyone would like to take ownership of this project**

At this point it is a prototype - it reads notes from existing file and builds a hierarchical list.
It does not show images, tables and code boxes.

## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter framework
2. Modify DAO.dart to point to a location where you have the Cherry Tree file
